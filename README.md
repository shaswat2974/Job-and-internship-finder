# Job-and-internship-finder
The "Job and Internship Finder" project is a Java-based application designed to assist users in searching for and adding job and internship opportunities. The project follows a modular approach with clearly defined model, data access, business logic, and user interface layers.

The model classes (Job, Internship, and User) represent the core data structures. The data access layer (JobRepository and InternshipRepository) manages data storage and retrieval using simple in-memory lists. The business logic layer (JobService) handles the creation and management of job entries, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

The user interface, implemented in MainApp.java, provides a simple, interactive console-based experience where users can add new job listings and view existing ones. This project can be expanded with additional features such as database integration, web interfaces, or more comprehensive search and filter functionalities.

It serves as an excellent foundation for understanding object-oriented design, repository patterns, and building basic CRUD operations in Java.
